# The Tab Closer Chrome Extension

As part of [Happyness By Design](http://happyness.design/tryit1) we have created a chrome extension to help you keep a good digital browsing hygiene. 

Our chrome extension, Closer, keeps a count of how many browser tabs you have opened. Upon opening a fair number of browser tabs, you will notice a smiley face turn sad and GIFs that reflect the change.

We hope you have fun with this little extension. For any suggestions on how to improve please reach out to us!

We are waiting to have this launched on the Chrome store, in the meantime, we have 2 ways of installation.

1) If you wish to play around with it and install you will require node and npm to run and build. 

2) Alternatively you can download the built package directly [here](https://happyness.design/closer) and simply load an unpacked extension.
